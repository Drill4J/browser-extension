# Design

To store designed UI wireframes, we are using [Invision](https://invisionapp.com).

To get access to TDM workspace, please contact our UX Designer.
Also you can discuss all design-related questions with her.

We already have stable style guide, witch includes colors palette, fonts, common elements and ect.
Strongly required to follow it! Color and font variables you can find in `/src/common/style-guide/` folder.

> It's not allowed to use colors and fonts not defined in style guide!<br/>
> We are open for suggestions, witch are help us to improve TDM design.
