# Technical stack

We use [webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) for cross-browser compatibility.

We use [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a rendering library.

We use [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) as a routing library.

We use [@redneckz/react-bem-helper](https://github.com/redneckz/react-bem-helper) as utility helps to declare BEM entities in terms of React components.

State management library is still TBD.
